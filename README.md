# Cardboard Magnet Extended Controls
This simple script extends the magnet controls for the [Cardboard SDK for Unity](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/unity/). 

With Cardboard Magnet Extended Controls, you will now be able to detect when the magnet is pulled or released as well as how long it was pulled.

###How it works
When the Cardboard magnet is pulled or released, the magnitude and the angle of the device compass' vector are both affected. This script uses that fact to effectively detect a pull or a release of the magnet.

Note : Not tested on many different devices. Your feedbacks would be greatly appreciated. 

A demo scene was added so you can easily test everything on your devices.
